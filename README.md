My humble adobe. High-school CS student. Graduating class of 2025 (drawing ever nearer. Not sure how I feel about this).

I tend to keep my own opinions (even if I do sometimes come of as insistant that others use them). Rust is my favorite language, with it's memory safety and the like. C is a nice change of pace, and to peer even deeper under the hood. C++ is a clusterfuck. Java is less so, but it's ecosystem is even more so.

I prefer to use Linux (typically Arch Linux, with custom compiled kernel, stdlib, etc...), but MacOS typically sufices.
