My humble adobe. High-school CS student. Graduating class of 2025 (drawing ever nearer; not sure how I feel about this).

I tend to keep my own opinions (even if I do sometimes come of as insistant that others use them). I like what's under the hood. But it can backfire, much like a car: it might explode (with you in it)!

Some don't care, and for good reason. If you are just doing basic ML, you don't need to learn how Tensorflow works on the inside. Unless you really want to squeeze out all the functionality you can. *Then*, you need to look under the hood. Or online :D

I prefer to use Linux (typically Arch Linux, with custom compiled kernel, stdlib, etc...), but MacOS typically sufices.
