My humble adobe. High-school CS student. Graduating class of 2025 (drawing ever nearly. Not sure how I feel about this).

I tend to keep my own opinions (even if I do sometimes come of as insistant that others use them). Rust is my favorite language, with it's memory safety and the like. C is a nice change of pace, and to peer even deeper under the hood. C++ is a clusterfuck. Java is less so, but it's ecosystem is even more so.

I prefer to use Linux (typically Arch Linux, with custom compiled kernel, stdlib, etc...), but MacOS typically sufices.


## Statistics
These don't update that often (haven't gotten around to spinning up my own Vercel instance). It's also worth noting that starting March 13, 2022, I have set my contribution counter up to acutally count my commits. Strange it wasn't already...
